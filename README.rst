waterpy
===============================

*waterpy* is a rainfall-runoff model that predicts the amount of water
flow in rivers. *waterpy* is a command line application written in Python
using Click_, and is a complete conversion of the original rainfall-runoff
model, called Topmodel, from Fortran to Python. The specific version of 
Topmodel that *waterpy* was initially based on a version by David Wolock, 
U.S. Geological Survey. Please see report below for more details: 

        Wolock, D.M., "Simulating the variable-source-area concept of
        streamflow generation with the watershed model Topmodel", U.S. Geological
        Survey, Water-Resources Investigations Report 93-4124, 1993.

The David Wolock version was recoded and reproduced in the `topmodelpy`_ project.

*waterpy* is a fork of the David Wolock version with many modifications in an 
attempt to replicate the Topmodel versions by Leon Kaufmann (USGS) and
Tanja Williamson (USGS). Please see report below for more details:

Features
--------

* Written entirely in Python for ease of use and model extension.
* Generates a report.hmtl file of model results with interactive plots.


Example
-------

<<<<<<< HEAD
To run the provided example edit the provided .ini files and insert the path names for the
input/output directory and location of the database directory.
=======
>>>>>>> b21aa33c4be91bdba14a980db6e5ac9e0ce56529
To run waterpy, give waterpy the command `run` along with the path to the 
model configuration file:

::

    $ waterpy run <path-to-your-modelconfig.ini>
    $ waterpy run data/modelconfig.ini

The model results are saved to the output directory location specified in
the model configuration file.

A sample model configuration file called `modelconfig.ini` is located in the 
`data/` directory along with sample input files located in the `inputs/`
directory and sample output files located in the `outputs/` directory.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The use of the geospatial tools requires a download/creationg of relevant files.
A database compiled for the state of Kentucky is available for download from
ScienceBase at https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f7e339682ce1d74e7dda351.
Geospatial tools also require a polygon shapefile of the basin area.  An example
shapefile is provided for use with this database in /example/Hope
The geospatial tools can be run from the command line.  Nagivate to the sample
directory as geospatial.py:::

    $ python geospatial.py

>>>>>>> b21aa33c4be91bdba14a980db6e5ac9e0ce56529


Installation
------------

To install waterpy from source:

1. Check that you have Python_ installed::

    $ python --version

If you do not have Python_ installed, please download the latest version from `Python's download page`_

2. Download waterpy from the repository and extract to a directory of your choice.

   Or, if you have git_ installed you can clone the project::

    $ git clone <remote url to waterpy>

3. Navigate to the project's root directory where the setup script called `setup.py` is located::

    $ cd waterpy/

| The `setup.py` is a Python file that contains information regarding the installation of a Python module/package, and
| usually specifies that the module/package has been packaged and distributed with the standard Python distribution
| package called Distutils_.

<<<<<<< HEAD
4. To install GDAL python geospatial .whl files are included for Python 3.7-3.9.::  

	$ pip install /utilities/GDAL-3.1.2-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl

	replace cp38 with you version of python.

5. pip install requirements.txt
	
6. Run `setup.py` with the `install` command::

    $ python setup.py install 

waterpy will now be installed to the standard location for third-party Python modules on your
computer platform.
=======
4. Run `setup.py` with the `install` command::

    $ python setup.py install

waterpy will now be installed to the standard location for third-party Python modules on your
computer platform.

All the required 3rd party packages in the "Requirements" section should be installed as well,
however, if the additional packages are not installed you can manually install them using `pip`::

    $ pip install click jinja2 matplotlib mpld3 numpy pandas scipy

or from within the parent *waterpy* directory::

    $ pip install requirements.txt
